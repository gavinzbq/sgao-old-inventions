Unit Test and Test-First Programming
------------------------------------

(Brief) Summary
===============

* Before writting code, step back and detail your requirements in a useful
  fashion.

* Write test and **FAIL** first. **Avoid** passing the test at the start.

* Do one thing at a time. Keep from over-coding.

* Each test case is an island.

About the Example
=================

The example code -- Roman Numerals is from `Dive Into Python`. Test-first
programming is illustrated by dividing the development into 5 (and more)
stages.

**Requirements for Roman Numerals**

I.There is only one correct way to represent a particular number as Roman
numerals.

II.The converse is also true.


III.Only numbers from 1 through 3,999 can be expressed as Roman numerals.


IV.No zero in Roman numerals. (The ancient Romans had no concecpt of zero as a
number, since numbers were for counting things. Amazing.)


V.No negative numbers in Roman numerals.


VI.No fractions or non-integer numbers in Roman numerals.
