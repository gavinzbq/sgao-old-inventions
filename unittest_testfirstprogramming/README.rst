Unit Test and Test-First Programming
------------------------------------


* Before writting code, step back and detail your requirements in a useful
  fashion

* Write test and **FAIL** first. **Avoid** passing the test at the start.

* Do one thing at a time. Keep from over-coding.

* Each test case is an island.

The example code -- Roman Numerals is from `Dive Into Python`. Test-first
programming is illustrated by dividing the development into 5 (and more)
stages.
